		<string>Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir is the world’s tallest temple under-construction at Vrindavan, Mathura, India. At cost of ₹300 crore (US$45 million) it will be one of the most expensively built temple in world by ISKCON. The temple has a footprint of about 5 acres and rises to a height of about 700 feet (213 meters or 70 floors) and a built-up area of 5,40,000 sq. ft. The temple is planned to be vibrant with festivals and religious activities throughout the year. A look-alike of the verdant forests of Vrindavan will be recreated around this magnificent temple. It will be spread over a sprawling 26 acres, it will consist of the twelve forests (dvadashakanana) of Braj, with varieties of lush vegetation, green pastures, elegant vistas of fruit bearing trees, flower laden creepers serenaded by bird songs, clear water lakes with lotuses and lilies and waterfalls that tumble from small artificial hillocks – all recreated from descriptions in the SrimadBhagavatam and other source books of Lord Sri Krishna – to transport the visitors to Krishna’s times in Vrindavan. The project is set in 62 acres of land and will include 12 acres for parking and a helipad.
The Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir is not just another sacred edifice of concrete, stone and glass. This project is dedicated to play a larger role in shaping the future of this country. Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir will not only house a temple for the worship of Lord Sri Krishna, but will also become a centre for disseminating the profound message of the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, delivered in a modern context. The design of the temple complex – a fusion of the modern and traditional Indian temple architecture – symbolises this aspiration, to present eternal wisdom from the source books of Krishna, in a way that is relevant to the modern day.
Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir is a tallest temple in the world and constructed in the cost of 300 crore. This Hindu temple is one of the famous Hindu temples in India. The height of the temple is about 700 feet and the area covered is 5, 40000 square feet. There is footprint of about 5 acres. The 26 acres consist of twelve forests with wide varieties of vegetation, green pastures, elegant vistas of fruit bearing trees, flower laden creepers serenaded by bird songs, clear water lakes with lotuses and lilies and waterfalls that tumble from small artificial hillocks.</string>

		<string>Sneh Bihari Temple</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Situated in the heart of Vrindavan is a renowned temple known as Shri Radha Sneh Bihari Mandir, which is based on Haridasiya Sampradhay. About 250 years ago there existed a small temple established by a scholar of Haridasiya Grhasti traditions, Shri Snehi Lal Goswami, the 10th generation Goswami of Swami Shri Haridas. Goswamiji was a true devotee and a shayan bhog seva adhikari of the world renowned, Shri Banke Bihari Mandir.

One day during his seva, he had a strong desire to obtain a child just like Bihariji. That very night, Bihariji appeared in his dream and told him to locate an area in his gaushala. An area situated on the land, underneath a specific dark colored cow. There he said, he would find a very special blessing where all these emotions would be fulfilled. Shri Snehilal Goswamiji quickly went to that location and to his surprise, on that very spot, he obtained a beautiful &quot;Shri Vigraha&quot; that was identical to Shri Banke Bihariji himself. This divine vigraha was given the name: Thakur Shri Radha Sneh Bihariji Maharaj. Soon after, a small temple was created and inaugurated to enshrine this beautiful form of Bihariji himself.

Shri Snehilal Goswamiji lived many years in the service of Thakurji, experiencing his grace from day to day. He one day left his body peacefully and went on to a higher abode. At this point his nephew, Shri Giridharlal Goswamiji Maharaj, a renowned sanskrit scholar known mainly for his Shrimad Bhagwat narrations. took on the responsibilities to oversee the temple and seva of the Lord.</string>

		<string>Radha Gopinath Mandir</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>During the oppression of Aurangzeb, the original deities of Gopinathji, Radhika and Jahnava also proceeded to Jaipurtogether with other deities. The Pratibhu Vigrahas now preside in the temple built by Nand Kumar Vasu. Jahnava Thakurani is seated on the left side of Gopinath, and Lalita Sakhi and a small deity of Radhika are seated on His right. The deity of Mahaprabhu Shri Gaurasundara is in a separate chamber. In 1632 AD, the original temple was built by Ray Singh, the son of the king of Bikaner, Maharaja Kalyanamala of the Rathaur dynasty. Aurangzeb destroyed this temple. The Pratibhu Vigrahas were established in 1748 AD, and the new temple was built in 1819 AD. Near the new temple to the east is the samadhi of Madhu Pandita. Close to the famous Vanshivat, on the bank of the Yamuna, Shri Paramanand Bhattacharya and Madhu Pandita used to worship Shri Radha-Krishna Yugala with extreme renunciation.
Once, the current of the Yamuna cut into her bank and a very beautiful deity of Shri Gopinath were revealed from under the sand. In the morning, when the devotee Paramananda came to the Yamuna to bathe, he found this exceptional deity who stole his heart. He entrusted the service of Shri Gopinath to Shri Madhu Pandita. First, Shri Gopinath resided near Vanshivat, but later on a magnificent new temple was constructed elsewhere and His service and worship continued there.</string>

		<string>Sewa Kunj also known as Nikunj Van is a van (forest); it has a mandir for Shree RadhaKrishn. It is believed that RadhaKrishn visit here every night. The nij mandir is decorated for them and all necessary items placed here for the night. This small mandir is decorated with all leelas painted on the walls which are very pretty.
This sacred place is known as Sewa Kunj because it is believed Shree Krishn did sewa for Shreemati Radharani here. This leela is depicted in paintings which show Shree Krishn combing Radharani’s hair, helping her get ready for the Raas Leela.
Some paintings also show Radhavihariji massaging Radharani’s charan when she gets tired during the Raas leela. These paintings are a depiction from the shloks found in the sacred Hindu scriptures.
The short trees as you will notice in the picture gallery always grow towards the ground, meaning that they always stand bowing to the Divine couple. Though in the day this place is flooded with monkeys, as soon as it nears evening they all leave the place empty; no living being stays in the area which is shut totally for the night.
There is a Kund here known as Lalita Kund. Here are some pictures from my many visits to the divine Sewa Kunj – Nikunj Van at Vrindavan Dham. I do hope you enjoy going through them.</string>

		<string>Imli Tala means tamarind tree. It is the place which represents the intense love in separation between Lord Radha and Krishna. There is an old Imli (Tamarind) tree present at the place since Dwapar Yuga, when Lord Krishna performed his pastimes. The Old tamarind tree died in early 19th century. Now only a branch of that tree grows here. Under the tree there is a small shrine having the deity of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in meditating pose.
Imli Tala, in short, is the place which epitomizes the intense love in separation between Radha and Krishna. In simple English language, Imli Tala means Tamarind tree. Imli Tala is the place, where Shrimati Radharani left the Sharad Purnima rasa dance, leaving Krishna searching for her in intense feelings of separation. Previously Imli Tala used to be near a ghat on the banks of the Yamuna but over the years Yamuna has changed its course and is now flowing at a distance from Imli Tala.</string>

		<string>This is the oldest temple in Vrindavan. Gopesvara Mahadeva is Lord Siva, who came to Vrindavan to become a gopi of Krishna. Here Vrinda Devi blessed him and allowed him to enter the rasa dance of Lord Krishna. Ever since, all Vaisnavas pray first for his mercy to become a servant of the servant of the gopis. Vajranabha, the great grandson of Krishna, also installed the Siva-linga in this temple. Every morning from 4 am to noon, thousands of people pour Yamuna water over the linga. It is said that the big pipal tree here is a kalpavriksa tree and will fulfil all desires.
Gopeshwar Mahadev Temple, sanctifying the beautiful land of Vrindavan is dedicated to the Gopeshwar form of Lord Shiva. The temple is situated near Vamshivat in Vrindavan. Huge number of devotees comes here to pay their obeisances to the Lord. Anyone who wishes to experience the bliss Raas Leela provides must pray to Gopeshwar for inducing him into Sakhibhav.
According to legends in the town, Lord Shiva is considered the first Vaishnav ever and the guru of all Vaishnays, because he is a devotee of Lord Vishnu, of whom, Lord Krishna is an avatar. In fact, it is believed that the relation between the two is mutual. While Shiva is devoted to Vishnu. Vishnu too, is a devotee of Shiva. Some highly regarded sages also say that these two are the same. Shiva and Vishnu are two forces of the same universe, the creator and the destroyer. This temple is also the symbol of the two sexual forces, and their entwined nature. In this temple, devotees worship the feminine form of Lord Shiva.</string>

		<string>Jugal Kishore Temple</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Jugal Kishore Temple was built by Raja Hindu pat Singh, the fourth Bundela King of Panna, during his reign from 1758 to 1778.
According to the legends, the idol placed in the garbha griha of this Hindu temple has been brought from Brindavana through Orcha. The ornaments and attire of the lord reflect the Bundelkhandi style. The temple has all the architectural features of Bundela temples including a Natya (Dancing Hall) mandapa, Bhog mandapa and a Pradakshna path (Circumbulation Path).
Jugal Kisore Temple (Kesi ghata temple) is one of the oldest temples of Vrindavan, completed in 1627. After Akbar’s visit to Vrindavan in the year 1570, he gave permission for four temples to be built by the Gaudiya Vaisnavas, which were Madana-mohana, Govindaji, Gopinatha and Jugal Kisore. It is sometimes called the Kesi ghata temple, as it is located next to this ghat. Kesi Ghat is a place where Lord Krishna had killed Kesi, the horse demon.
During the rule of King Akbar in 1570 Gaudiya Vaishnava community from Vrindavan asked permission to establish some temples in Vrindavan. King Akbar permitted four temples in Vrindavan – Mandan Mohan Temple, Govind Dev Temple, Jugal Kishore Temple and Shri Gopinath Temple. But latter on King Aurangzeb attacked three out of these four temples and original deities were move to somewhere else. Only Jugal Kishore Temple remained in Vrindavan with its original temple and original deity.</string>

		<string>Vishram Ghat</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Vishram Ghat is a ghat, a bath and worship place, on the banks of river Yamuna in Mathura, India. It is the main ghat of Mathura and is central to 25 other ghats. The traditional parikrama starts and ends at Vishram Ghat. Lord Krishna is said to have rested at this place after killing Kansa. It is at Vishram Ghat that the traditional parikrama starts and ends.

The Vishram ghat is lined with elegant temple and some of Mathura&apos;s most important shrines are found here - the Mukut Temple, Radha-Damodar, Murli Manohar, Neelkantheshwar, Yamuna-Krishna, Langali Hanuman and Narasimha temples. The baithak of the great Vaishnava, Shri Chaitanya, is also near by. The aarti held at the Vishram Ghat each evening is not to be missed, for the little oil lamps that are floated on the river set the placid water asparkle with a myriad flickering lights. History tells us that this important site was ravaged and patronized in equal measure over the ages, It was badly damaged during the early invasions but two Vaishnavite saints, Keshav Kashmiri and Vallabhacharya restored its sanctity during the time of Sikander Lodhi. It received lavish patronage during the tolerant rule of Akbar when the temples were repaired and embellished but again time and events took their toll.</string>

		<key>description</key>
		<string>Daan-Ghati is one of the two main temple structures in Govardhan, near Mathura, India. The other temple structure is called Dasvisa.

Daan Ghati is a temple where the deity is actually in the form of a rock. The deity is said to be going down in earth by a few millimeters every year. Local people who have been witnessing this confirm this fact, though there is no scientific proof for the same.

Over time, this temple has slowly taken over the place of main shrine of the town. Added to the fact, there has been quite a bit of commercialization of the temple structure. With ever growing touristic importance of the place, the commercial interests are growing and at times conflicts as well.</string>

In the Mathura-mahatmya it is recommended that one bathe in Manasi Ganga and then take darshan of Hrideva before beginning here. This kunda is considered a million times more potent than the Ganges River, because by bathing in the Ganges River one gets liberation and by bathing here one gets &quot;Krishna prema,&quot; love of Krishna. 

It is a good-size lake located in the town of Govardhana. It is in the center of Govardhana Hill. Manasi Ganga used to be a very large lake, but as Govardhana Hill is getting smaller, Manasi Ganga is also getting smaller in the same proportion.</string>

During Lord Caitanya’s time this place was known as Sumanah Sarovara. It is stated in the Caitanya Caritamrita that Lord Caitanya took bath here. The ghatas at this kunda and the buildings above the kunda were built by Jawa hir Singh, the king of Bharatpur around 1764, in honor of his father Raja Suraj Mall. Suraj Mall attacked the Mughal King of Delhi and was killed in the battle. His son Jawa hir Singh then attacked Delhi and killed the Mughal king. On the upper level are three tombs. The main tomb of Raja Suraj Mall has beautiful paintings on its ceiling depicting the pastimes of Krishna and the lotus feet of Krishna engraved on the floor.

		<string>Kushal Bihari Temple</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>The beautiful temple of Kushal Bihari was built by a Rajput king who was an ardent devotee of Radha-Krishna. The sculpture inside the temple is carved out of sandstone having slinky and beautiful designs. A graceful and lovely idol of Shri Radha is being placed at the centre of the premises. Before inaugurating the temple, it is believed that Radha came to King&apos;s dream and asked him not to proceed with inauguration as it is not original place which belongs to Radha or ladliji. Thus, king built another temple for Ladliji or Radhaji on her place of origin and in the Kushal Bihari temple still you can see beautiful idols of Krishna, Radha and their allies in beautiful postures. This is one of the most beauteous places in the Mathura tourism and one should visit it during the tour to Barsana.</string>

		<string>Brahmanda Ghat</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>It is the place where Lord Krishna performed his pastime of showing the whole universe inside his mouth to his foster mother Yashoda. According to the legend, once all the Gopas came to mother Yashoda and informed her that her son Krishna has eaten mud. Mother Yashoda got angry at the deed of Krishna and accompanied Gopas to the place where Krishna was playing, so as to scold him. On reaching she enquired Krishna if he has eaten mud but Krishna denied saying that all the Gopas are lying and he never ate mud. Then Yashoda enquired the truth from Lord Balram who confirmed that Krishna had eaten mud. On asking Krishna again denied that he had not eaten mud. To prove the truth, Yashoda asked Krishna to open his mouth and show if he has not eaten mud. When Krishna opened his small mouth, mother Yashoda was stunned at the sight of the whole universe revolving inside the mouth of Krishna. After having the view of such a sight inside the mouth of her Krishna she lost her senses. A beautiful temple commemorating this pastime is built on the bank of this Ghat and is named as Brahmanda Bihari temple.</string>
